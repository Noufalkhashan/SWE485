<h3> Project Motivation</h3>
<p>The motivation behind selecting the Stroke Prediction Dataset for our project is deeply rooted in the global health impact of strokes. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), strokes rank as the second leading cause of mortality worldwide, responsible for approximately 11% of all recorded deaths. This alarming statistic highlights the urgent need for effective risk assessment, early intervention, and preventive measures to reduce the burden of stroke-related health issues and fatalities.

Our project aims to leverage this dataset to develop an AI-powered solution capable of predicting stroke risk accurately. By analyzing a wide range of patient-specific factors, such as gender, age, medical history, and smoking status, we aspire to create a robust predictive model. The goal is to provide healthcare professionals with a valuable tool for assessing stroke risk, enabling them to identify at-risk individuals and initiate timely interventions. In doing so, we hope to contribute to the global effort to reduce stroke-related morbidity and mortality, ultimately improving the quality of healthcare and saving lives. </p>
